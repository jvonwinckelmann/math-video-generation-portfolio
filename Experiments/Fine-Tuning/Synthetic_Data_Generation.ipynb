Anstatt Codebeispiele für ein Fine-Tuning des kleineren Modells mittels der unter nicht-kommerziellen Creative Commons Lizenz stehenden Videocodes zu verwenden, kann ein bestehendes größeres Qwen2.5-Coder Modell (etwa 14B oder 32B) verwendet werden, um in der Pipeline den Code für einige Beispiele zu generieren, die dann genutzt werden können, um das kleine Modell zu verbessern und potenziell auf das gleiche Niveau zu heben.\n",
