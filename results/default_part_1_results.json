    "video_plan": "To draw a triangle with vertices A(1, 1), B(5, 1), and C(3, 4) on a coordinate system, follow these detailed steps: 1. **Set up the Coordinate System**: - Draw two perpendicular intersecting axes: one vertical (y-axis) and one horizontal (x-axis). - Add arrows at each end of the axes to indicate the positive direction: upwards for the y-axis and rightwards for the x-axis. 2. **Label the Axes**: - Label the y-axis as 'y'. - Label the x-axis as 'x'. 3. **Mark Units**: - Choose a scale where two boxes (or units) make up one line or column. - Use straight lines on each axis to mark the units. 4. **Set the Origin**: - Mark the intersection of the x- and y-axes as O. 5. **Plot Individual Points**: - Create a cross or dot at A(1, 1). Move one unit interval right from O along the x-axis and then move one unit up along the y-axis. - Draw and label this point as A. - Create another cross or point for point B(5, 1). Move five units to the right of O along the x-axis with no movement vertically on the y-axis. - Draw and label this point as B. - Finally, create a cross or dot for the last vertex C(3, 4). Move three units right from O along the x-axis, then four units up along the y-axis. - Draw and label this point as C. 6. **Connect Coordinates**: - Draw a line between A(1, 1) and B(5, 1). - Connect B(5, 1) to C(3, 4) with another line. - Complete the triangle by drawing a line from C(3, 4) back to A(1, 1). By following these steps, you have successfully constructed and drawn the triangle on the coordinate system."
